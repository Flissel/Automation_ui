# Desktop Capture Client Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the desktop capture client system to ensure proper cleanup, reduce terminal spam, and provide seamless operation.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Terminal Spam from Excessive Logging
**Problem**: The WebSocket server was logging every frame_data message and heartbeat, causing terminal spam and making it difficult to debug.

**Solution**: 
- Reduced heartbeat frequency from 30 to 60 seconds
- Implemented conditional logging for heartbeats (only 10% are logged)
- Reduced frame_data logging to 1% of messages
- Added streaming state tracking to better manage when to log

**Files Modified**:
- `local-websocket-server.js`: Added conditional logging and reduced frequencies

### 2. Lack of Proper Client Cleanup
**Problem**: Desktop clients didn't have proper signal handlers for graceful shutdown, leading to abrupt disconnections.

**Solution**:
- Added signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM in the desktop client
- Implemented proper disconnect sequence with client_disconnect message
- Enhanced the disconnect method with timeout handling and error recovery
- Added graceful WebSocket closure with proper cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `desktop_capture_client.py`: Added signal handlers and improved disconnect method

### 3. Stream State Management
**Problem**: The server didn't properly track streaming states for each client.

**Solution**:
- Added `streamingStates` Map to track streaming state for each desktop client
- Updated state tracking when start/stop stream commands are processed
- Improved cleanup when clients disconnect

**Files Modified**:
- `local-websocket-server.js`: Added streamingStates tracking

### 4. Client Disconnection Handling
**Problem**: The UI didn't properly handle client disconnections and cleanup.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the WebSocket server to handle `client_disconnect` messages
- Improved client removal and notification system
- Added proper cleanup in the MultiDesktopStreams component

**Files Modified**:
- `local-websocket-server.js`: Enhanced disconnection handling
- `MultiDesktopStreams.tsx`: Already had proper disconnection handling

### 5. Multi-Monitor Detection and Support
**Problem**: The original desktop capture client only supported single monitor capture using `ImageGrab.grab()`, which captures the entire virtual screen but doesn't provide monitor-specific control.

**Solution**:
- Added `_detect_monitors()` method using tkinter to detect monitor configurations
- Enhanced client capabilities to report multi-monitor support
- Implemented monitor detection logic that distinguishes between single and dual monitor setups
- Added monitor information tracking with detailed metadata for each detected monitor
- Enhanced capture configuration to support different capture modes ('primary', 'all_monitors', 'specific_monitor')

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses tkinter's `winfo_screenwidth()`, `winfo_screenheight()`, `winfo_vrootwidth()`, and `winfo_vrootheight()` for monitor detection
- Implements heuristic detection: if virtual width > screen width * 1.5, assumes dual monitor setup
- Stores detailed monitor information including position, dimensions, and primary status
- Provides fallback to single monitor configuration in case of detection errors

**Monitor Information Structure**:
```python
monitor_info = {
    'monitor_0': {
        'index': 0,
        'name': 'Primary Monitor',
        'x': 0, 'y': 0,
        'width': 1920, 'height': 1080,
        'is_primary': True
    },
    'monitor_1': {
        'index': 1,
        'name': 'Secondary Monitor', 
        'x': 1920, 'y': 0,
        'width': 1920, 'height': 1080,
        'is_primary': False
    }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `desktop_capture_client.py`: Added multi-monitor detection and management capabilities
